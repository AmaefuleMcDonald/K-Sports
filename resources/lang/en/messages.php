    The increase during the Women's World Cup year featured deep in financial documents approved by the FIFA Council on Thursday and sent to global football officials.
    
    Mr Infantino's base salary was 1.95m Swiss francs (£1.7m) in 2022 with a bonus of 1.65m Swiss francs (£1.5m) - a total equating to about £3.2m.",

    'News2' => "Former Premier League referee Jon Moss left his role with referees' body the PGMOL after clashing with other officials, it has been claimed.

    Moss, 53, spent more than a decade as a referee in English football's top tier. His final Premier League season came in 2021-22, while he also took charge of the Championship play-off final between Huddersfield Town and Nottingham Forest.
    
    The following year, he was handed a post by the PGMOL as the director of Premier League officials, having initially joined as manager of the group in question. However, he lasted less than a year in his most recent role, leaving this month with immediate effect.
    
    According to The Telegraph, his exit followed a 'bitter' falling out with a number of leading officials. The same publication notes that referees chief Howard Webb will take over Moss' responsibilities for the remainder of the 2023-24 season.",
