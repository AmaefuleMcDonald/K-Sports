                    <h1>Ex-Premier League referee Jon Moss left top PGMOL role after 'bitter fallout' with top refs</h1>
                    <p>Former Premier League referee Jon Moss left his role with referees' body the PGMOL after clashing with other officials, it has been claimed.

Moss, 53, spent more than a decade as a referee in English football's top tier. His final Premier League season came in 2021-22, while he also took charge of the Championship play-off final between Huddersfield Town and Nottingham Forest.

The following year, he was handed a post by the PGMOL as the director of Premier League officials, having initially joined as manager of the group in question. However, he lasted less than a year in his most recent role, leaving this month with immediate effect.

According to The Telegraph, his exit followed a "bitter" falling out with a number of leading officials. The same publication notes that referees chief Howard Webb will take over Moss' responsibilities for the remainder of the 2023-24 season.</p>
